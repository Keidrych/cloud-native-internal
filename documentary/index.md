# Agnostic:

This is the core repository of a collection of Git repositories to enable _Agnostic Software Development_. A coding style and pattern that works on any Ubiquitous platform (Kubernetes Included). This particular project is in [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/) but the processes and techniques are applicable to any language.

This project strives hard not to be classified as a framework, as such it tries to provide a collection of best practice approaches (somewhat opinionated) for operating software at scale and speed.

The approaches suggested / undertaken are production grade and underpin some of the more forward thinking Enterprises.
